## UrbanStore -Shopping Cart Built Using React,TypeScript,Material UI ,React Query & Firebase

This is a shopping website built using React as a Front-end & Firebase as Back-end. It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of shopping website. It's a similar version of shopping website with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React to build something advanced. It contains a shopping cart a Navbar, CartItems.
